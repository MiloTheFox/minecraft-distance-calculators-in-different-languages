## Introduction

This Python program calculates the distance between two points in 3D space. It provides two distance metrics: Euclidean and Manhattan. You can choose the method for calculating the distance and enter the coordinates of the two points to get the result.

## Features

- Calculates Euclidean and Manhattan distances between two 3D points.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- Input validation to ensure valid numeric input.
- Error handling for invalid inputs or methods.

## Installation

To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't already have it, you can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Tooth-Fox11/minecraft-distance-calculators-in-different-languages.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the Python directory:

    ```shell
    cd minecraft-distance-calculators-in-different-languages/Python
    ```

3. Run the program:

    ```shell
    python main.py
    ```

Please ensure that you have Python installed and configured on your system before proceeding with the installation and usage of this program.

## Usage

The Python program is interactive and will guide you through the process of calculating distances between 3D points. Here's how to use it:

1. Enter the coordinates of Point 1 (x y z) when prompted.

2. Enter the coordinates of Point 2 (x y z) when prompted.

3. Enter the distance calculation method you want to use, either "euclidean" or "manhattan."

4. The program will calculate and display the distance using the chosen method.
