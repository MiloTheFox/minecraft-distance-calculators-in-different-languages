## Introduction

Welcome to the 3D Distance Calculator program! This program, written in Rust, calculates the distance between two points in 3D space using two different distance metrics: Euclidean and Manhattan. You can select the calculation method and provide the coordinates of the two points to get the result.

## Features

- Calculates both Euclidean and Manhattan distances between two 3D points.
- Offers a user-friendly command-line interface.
- Performs input validation to ensure only valid numeric input is accepted.
- Includes error handling to deal with invalid inputs or method choices.

## Usage

To run this program, make sure you have the Rust programming language and the Cargo package manager installed on your system. If not, you can install them by following the instructions at [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Once you have Rust and Cargo installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/LunaTheFox20/minecraft-distance-calculators-in-different-languages.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```shell
    cd minecraft-distance-calculators-in-different-languages/Rust
    ```

3. Compile and run the Rust code:

    ```shell
    cargo run
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input coordinates and select the distance calculation method.

Please ensure that you have Rust and Cargo properly configured on your system before proceeding with the installation and usage of this program.
